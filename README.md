# Cable-driven-parallel-robot-for-NDT
Software to control a non-destructive system based on a cable driven parallel robot (CDPR) to evaluate the structural integrity of large structures
The software developed for the CDPR consists of two complementary Python-based systems, each designed for a different tomographic modality: 

LadyBug performs automated sonic tomography, using a controlled impact mechanism to generate acoustic waves for structural assessment.

LadyGPR, on the other hand, enables electromagnetic tomography by integrating a commercial ground-penetrating radar (GPR), replacing the impact device with a fully non-contact sensing approach.
